Old SpellBook - Classic Spellbook UI Restoration
================================================

**Overview**  
_Old SpellBook_ is an addon designed to bring back the familiar look and feel of the original spellbook UI. It's ideal for players who find the new spellbook interface overly complex or not to their liking.

**Why Was This Addon Created?**  
When Blizzard updated the spellbook UI in modern WoW, many players felt that the new design lost some of the simplicity and charm of earlier versions and was unnecessarily large. _Old SpellBook_ was created to restore the classic, streamlined interface for those who prefer it.

**Known Issues:**

*   **Flyout Spells:** Currently, flyout spells (such as teleport or portals) aren't fully supported in the spellbook. I'm trying to make them work, but something in Blizzard's tomfoolery of client UI code is tricky to understand.
*   **Pet abilities:** Same as Flyout Spells. They will be added in a future update.
*   **Experimental:** This addon is in an experimental phase and _will_ contain bugs. While it should be regularly updated, it isn't at all as polished as I would like it to be.

Please report any bugs or issues with as much context as possible, as they can sometimes be tricky to reproduce.

**Installation:**

1.  Download the latest version of _Old SpellBook_.
2.  Go to **Options > Keybindings > Old Spellbook** and define your "Show Spellbook" keybind.
